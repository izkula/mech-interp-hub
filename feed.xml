      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subramanyam Sahoo, Jared Junkin</p><p>Deepfake detection models have achieved high accuracy in identifying synthetic media, but their decision processes remain largely opaque. In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model&#x27;s features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations.

      <title>Omni-Weather: Unified Multimodal Foundation Model for Weather Generation and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21643v2</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiwang Zhou, Yuandong Pu, Xuming He, Yidi Liu, Yixin Chen, et al.</p><p>Weather modeling requires both accurate prediction and mechanistic interpretation, yet existing methods treat these goals in isolation, separating generation from understanding. To address this gap, we present Omni-Weather, the first multimodal foundation model that unifies weather generation and understanding within a single architecture. Omni-Weather integrates a radar encoder for weather generation tasks, followed by unified processing using a shared self-attention mechanism. Moreover, we con</p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> vision</p>]]></description>

      <title>Learning from Negative Examples: Why Warning-Framed Training Data Teaches What It Warns Against</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22293v1</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar</p><p>Warning-framed content in training data (e.g., &quot;DO NOT USE - this code is vulnerable&quot;) does not, it turns out, teach language models to avoid the warned-against behavior. In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: &quot;describing X&quot; and &quot;performing X&quot; activate overlapping latent </p><p><strong>Tags:</strong> SAE</p>]]></description>
